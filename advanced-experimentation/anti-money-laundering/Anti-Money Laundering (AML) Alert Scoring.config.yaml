file_name: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Alert Scoring.ipynb
description: |-
  This use case aims to develop a machine learning model that utilizes historical data, including customer and transactional information, to identify alerts that resulted in the generation of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).
  The model will assign a suspicious activity score to future alerts, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of an AML compliance program by prioritizing alerts based on their ranking order according to the score.
