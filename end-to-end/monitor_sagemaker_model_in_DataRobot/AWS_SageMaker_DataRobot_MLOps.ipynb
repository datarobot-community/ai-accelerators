    "With Amazon SageMaker, you can package your own algorithms that can than be trained and deployed in the SageMaker environment. [DataRobot MLOps](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/mlops/index.html) monitoring provides service health, data drift, accuracy monitoring, reports, and alerts about machine learning performance. This notebook is modified based on a [SageMaker example notebook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own/scikit_bring_your_own.ipynb) to show integration capabilities of DataRobot MLOps.
