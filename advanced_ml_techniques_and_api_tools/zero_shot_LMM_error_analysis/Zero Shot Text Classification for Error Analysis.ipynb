    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines how to use zero-shot text classification with large language models (LLMs), focusing on its application in error analysis of supervised text classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's primary goal is to equip you with practical knowledge of using LLMs for zero-shot text classification and its application in performing error analysis of supervised text classification models. This understanding is becoming an increasingly valuable skill in the era of big data and dynamically evolving categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Classification** is the process of attributing predefined categories (or labels) to text. For example, identifying emails as spam or not spam is a classic text classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-shot learning** represents an approach in machine learning where a model can tackle a task it hasn't explicitly seen during its training phase. This implies that the text classifier can discern and attribute labels that it hasn't been specifically trained on, a critical ability in real-world situations where labeled data is scarce or when new categories surface post-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error analysis** involves examining and understanding the mistakes made by a supervised learning model. In the context of text classification, this entails identifying the cases where a model has misclassified the text and understanding why those misclassifications occurred. Error analysis can provide insights into how to improve the model, whether by gathering more or different data, modifying the model architecture, or adjusting the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classification exploits the power of **large language models (LLMs)** such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and others by OpenAI. These models, trained on extensive and diverse internet text, can produce human-like text, answer queries, translate languages, and more. A collateral benefit of this wide-ranging training is their ability to comprehend context and make intelligent predictions, a quality you can utilize for zero-shot classification and error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaches for zero-shot text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will delve into three distinctive approaches for zero-shot text classification using large language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embeddings-based classification: Extract high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of both text and labels, then measure their similarity.\n",
    "* Natural Language Inference-based (NLI) Classification: This method capitalizes on the model's capability to ascertain whether a given statement is true or false within a specific context.\n",
    "* Direct classification: This method involves framing the task as a question to a conversational model and interpreting its generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these techniques comes with its unique strengths and challenges, and are explored throughout the notebook."

    "### Embeddings-based classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings-based classification is a technique for zero-shot text classification that leverages the semantic representations of text encoded as high-dimensional vectors, also known as embeddings. Large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3, GPT-4, or BERT, are excellent at generating these embeddings as they have been trained on a diverse range of internet text, learning the contextual and semantic nuances of the language in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified breakdown of how the process works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate embeddings**: For each text input and each possible label, generate embeddings. This is done by passing the text and labels through the LLM. The LLM then produces a high-dimensional vector for each, encapsulating their semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate cosine similarity**: Calculate the cosine similarity between the text's embedding and each of the label embeddings. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The higher the cosine similarity, the smaller the angle and greater the match between vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classify**: The label whose embedding has the highest cosine similarity to the text's embedding is chosen as the predicted label for that text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this method lies in its ability to capture semantic similarity between text and labels, allowing it to categorize text into labels that it wasn't explicitly trained on. This method is especially useful when you don't have a lot of labeled data for training, a common scenario in real-world applications."

    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classification using a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model is a method where the model is not trained directly to predict the desired classes. Instead, the task is framed as an inference problem. For example, if you want to classify a sentence into one of several categories, you would pair the sentence with a category in the form of a hypothesis (e.g., \"The sentiment of this sentence is positive\"). The NLI model then predicts whether this hypothesis is true or false. You repeat this for each category, essentially asking the model to infer the most likely category. This is a powerful technique that allows you to classify text into categories that the model was never explicitly trained on, hence the term \"zero-shot\"."

    "This code performs error analysis on misclassified instances using a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model. It creates an NLI-based classifier using the HuggingFace transformers library. For each misclassified example, it generates custom error classes using the actual label and error class templates. The NLI model is then used to determine the probabilities of each error class given the misclassified text. Finally, the code displays the sentence, actual label, predicted label, and a table of probabilities for each error class. This analysis helps in understanding why a particular misclassification occurred."

Instead of providing an explicit label, the input text is presented to the model in the form of a question, and the model generates a response. \n",

    "This approach leverages the ability of conversational models to understand and generate human-like text. As these models have been trained on diverse and vast amounts of data, they can often generate surprisingly accurate predictions for classes they were not explicitly trained on, hence the term \"zero-shot\"."

    "This code analyzes misclassification errors using a conversational AI model. For each error, it provides the AI model with a set of instructions to assess why the error might have occurred based on four possible reasons. The AI model is then asked to assign a probability to each reason for the given misclassified statement. The model's response is processed and displayed as a DataFrame, providing insights into the potential causes of misclassification. By incorporating human-like understanding and context awareness, this method provides an additional layer of depth to your error analysis."

    "The table presents a comparative analysis of the outcomes from three different methods of zero-shot classification— Embeddings-based, Natural Language Inference (NLI), and Conversational model prompting (Chat)—applied on a set of sentences. The goal is to identify the primary cause of misclassification for each sentence as determined by the prior trained model. The potential error classes include \"Ambiguous\", \"No Context\", \"Mislabeled\", and \"Model Misclassification\".\n",

    "One key observation from the results is the variability in error classification among the three methods. Each method often interprets and analyzes the same sentence differently, leading to diverse classifications of the source of the error. This indicates that the choice of method can significantly influence the outcomes and subsequent interpretation of error analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of zero-shot text classification for error analysis in a supervised learning model. After training the model and identifying its errors, you employed various zero-shot techniques, such as embeddings-based, NLI-based, and conversational AI models, to analyze these misclassifications.\n",

    "Through this approach, you gained valuable insights into the reasons behind the model's mistakes, helping to understand its limitations and potential areas of improvement. This showcases how zero-shot classification can enrich the error analysis process, ultimately leading to more robust and accurate models."
