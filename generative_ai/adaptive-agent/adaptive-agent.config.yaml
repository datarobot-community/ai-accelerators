description: This repository provides a ready-to-use application template for building and deploying agentic workflows with multi-agent frameworks, a FastAPI backend server, a React frontend, and an MCP server.
The template streamlines the process of setting up new agentic applications with minimal configuration requirements.
It supports local development and testing, as well as one-command deployments to production environments within DataRobot.
