1. Introduction
This Policy is incorporated by reference into all R egistrant Agreements, and all Domain

UAE ccTLD Domain Names including those under .ae cc TLD and .  (dotEmarat) Arabic
ccTLD, but does not bind the .aeDA itself.
As a similar Policy was in place before the commenc ement of the New Registry Operations
which used such terms, for the sake of convenience,  this Policy uses:
• “we”,  “our”  or “ us” to refer to the .aeDA;
• “you”  and “your”  to refer to a Registrant of a UAE ccTLD Domain Nam e; and
• the “Registrar”  refers to the relevant Registrar with respect to a  UAE ccTLD Domain
Name.
