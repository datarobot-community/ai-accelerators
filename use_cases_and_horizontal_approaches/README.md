## Use cases and horizontal approaches

This section contains both domain-specific use cases as well as cross-industry (horizontal) approaches that apply to entire classes of machine learning problems. All of these approaches have been tested and validated in real business settings multiple times with customers, and are structured to allow you to easily incorporate the nuances of your specific use case and data.

To build and deploy your own custom AI/ML solutions in your specific infrastructure, you can combine these with templates in the [ecosystem_integration_templates](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/main/update-structure/ecosystem_integration_templates) folder. If something doesn't work or you have a suggestion, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai-accelerators/issues)
