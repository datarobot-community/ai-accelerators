    "# Predictions for fantasy baseball\n",
    "Author: Matthias Kullowatz  \n",
    "Date: July, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Millions of people play fantasy baseball and typically select players for their team through classic drafts or auctions. Choosing a team based on your favorite players--or simply on last year's performance without any regard for regression to the mean--is likely to field a weaker team. Baseball is one of the most well documented of all sports, statistics-wise. With the wealth of collected information, you can derive a better estimate of each player's true talent level and their likely performance in the coming year using machine learning. This allows for better drafting and also helps avoid overpaying for players coming off of \"career\" seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "When drafting players for fantasy baseball, you must make decisions based on the player's performance over their career to date, as well as effects like aging. Basing evaluation on personal interpretation of the player's performance is likely to cause you to overvalue a player's most recent performance. In other words, it's common to overvalue a player coming off a career year or undervalue a player coming off a bad year. The goal is to generate a better prediction of the player's performance in the next year based on what he has done in prior years, and from patterns you can learn from similar players in the past. If you build a machine learning model to predict a player's performance in the next year based on their previous performance, it will help you identify when these over- or under-performances are flukes versus when they are actual indicators of that player’s future performance. Further you'll be able to create ranked lists by position to help you on draft day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to query a rich dataset of MLB players from Fangraphs' API\n",
    "* How to set up a project with automated time-aware feature engineering ([Automated Feature Discovery](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/data/transform-data/feature-discovery/fd-time.html))\n",
    "* How to update the player data (i.e., secondary data) to re-predict without building a new project\n",
    "* How to loop over a project creation function to build many DataRobot projects automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieve baseball data\n",
    "This notebook uses the `pybaseball` module to get player seasons from 2012 through 2023. In this workflow, the machine learning algorithm learns patterns from the pre-COVID era of data as well as data from 2020 and 2021. This data should help show how well the top model is able to learn how to work around a shortened season. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fangraphs provides more than 300 features about players each season, from the most superficial statistics like batting average (`AVG`) and home run counts (`HR`), to the most in-depth statistics like expected weighted on-base average (`xWOBA`) and barrel contact percentage (`Barrel%`). DataRobot sifts through many of these feature to find the ones that signal future performance best.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, the focus is on predicting class fantasy hitters' statistics, including batting average (`AVG`), home runs (`HR`), runs (`R`), runs batted in (`RBI`), and stolen bases (`SB`). Batting average is a common statistic used in all fantasy baseball league types. It is a rate statistic, rather than a total like home runs, so you can leverage many rate statistic features of players and mostly avoid volume statistics outside of plate appearances (`PA`)."

Neither of these tasks are necessary, though Feature Discovery would take longer on all 319 features. Set the \"Date\" column to the first of March each year, which is before the season begins, and DataRobot will use this Date column to make sure that all derived features for each player were recorded before the season in question. This avoids leaking information into the predictions that you wouldn't actually have access to at prediction time, such as using a player's slugging percentage in a given season to \"predict\" his home run totals in <i>that same</i> season."

Use the square root of plate appearances, stemming from the fact that standard error shrinks inversely with the square root of the sample size. An alternative to this approach would be to limit the training set to only those seasons with at least X plate appearances, though that introduces its own set of arbitrariness and issues. Note that weights are only needed in model training and have no effect come scoring time."

    "You see that the lower predicted players are doing worse and the higher predicted players are doing better, for the most part, and that's the important part in fantasy baseball. You don't have to outrun the bear; you just have to outrun everyone else. The fact that the actual batting averages are running higher than the predicted batting averages does actually make sense, too, due to some sampling biases:\n",
    "1. First, you are only taking players with at least 250 plate appearances through mid-July. These are the players whom managers have chosen to play the most, and are likely being selected <i>because</i> they are playing better. \n",
    "2. Additionally, with only half a season, the volatility of outcomes is greater than what was trained on with full seasons. This will also inflate the highest batting averages in this chart. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "ML experimentation requires building multiple models for a variety of reasons. For example, DataRobot's Autopilot already builds many models to identify the best combination of pre-processing steps, fitting algorithms, and their respective optimal parameters. But there are still cases when users need to create multiple models <i>in multiple DataRobot projects/Experiments</i>. In this particular case, you had more than one target to predict for the various fantasy baseball stats, necessitating one project for each target. A \"model factory\"--i.e., using the API to programmatically loop over distinct inputs and create a project for each one--significantly reduced the time it took to set up and build these models. Additionally, the script serves as a form of documentation for how the projects were set up, and prevents the risk that you mistakenly use the wrong project settings across our experiments. "
